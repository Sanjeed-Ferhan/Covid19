<body>
<h2 style="color:red;">Clean Your Hands often</h2>
<p><u1>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
<li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<h2 style="color:Red;">Avoid close contact</h2>
<p><li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
	<li>Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li><li>Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li><li>woman covering their mouth when coughing</li>
<h2 style="color:Red;">Cover coughs and sneezes</h2>
<p><li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li><li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li><li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
<h2 style="color:Red;"> Wear a facemask if you are sick</h2>
<p><li>If you are sick:  You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare providerâ€™s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li><li>If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.</li>
<h2 style="color:Red;">
Clean and disinfect</h2>
<p><li>Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</li><li>If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.</li><br>
